Linear regression: 


Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
When there is only one independent feature, it is known as Simple Linear Regression, and when there are more than one feature, it is known as Multiple Linear Regression.
Similarly, when there is only one dependent variable, it is considered Univariate Linear Regression, while when there are more than one dependent variables, it is known as Multivariate Regression.
